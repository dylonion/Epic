Phases (expanded):
  Mulligan phase (before game proper begins): both players may choose x cards
  for the bottom of deck, draw x cards, and lose x health.
  Gold reset (phase[0]): Set the gold of both players to 1 (no actions)
  draw phase:
              - active player draws card (except on player1 turn1).
              - prepare all champions of active player
              - fire all 'start of turn' triggers
  main phase:
              - Active player actions
              - inactive player actions
  attack phase:
              - Active player chooses attacking champions (if they are ready)
              - Active player plays powers and events
              - Inactive player plays powers and events
              (repeat this and previous step until both players pass)
              - Inactive player choses champions to block.
                those champs enter blocking state and can block nothing else.
              - Active player plays powers and events
              - Inactive player plays powers and events
              (repeat this and previous step until both players pass)
              - Damage: attackers and defenders deal their offense
              to the opposing defense simultaniously. Broken champs
              are put in graveyard. Both players decide how to allocate damage.
              - Resolve triggered abilities produced during damage step.
              - Resolve 'end of combat' triggers
              (Repeat from start of attack phase until Active player passes.)
              - Active player passes
  post battle phase:
              - Inactive player may play cards.
  End phase:
              - Resolve 'end of turn' triggers
              - Active player discards down to seven cards
              - damage is removed from champions (defense is reset to default value)
              - flipped (blocking) champs are prepared
